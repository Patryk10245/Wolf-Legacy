# Wolf-Legacy

Wolf Legacy is a reference to the times, where the player passed levels while defeating multitudes of enemies with the intention of liberating the area from the forces of evil. All this is done in hand-drawn graphics, which resembles old productions, while building a similar atmosphere to them. 

Four types of heroes, a couple of types of enemies and bosses were prepared for the project. A village was created, where the player can upgrade himself, as well as levels where he fights his battles.

Screenshoots!
